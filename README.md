# Graduate Course Research
This folder contains two text documents comprising final research projects for the courses CSDS 491, AI: Sequential Decision Making, and CSDS 440, Machine Learning. The CSDS 491 project was conducted over a period of two months, whereas the CSDS 440 work was completed within a span of roughly 1.5 months owing to its summer course schedule. The projects were carried out in groups, with a focus on extensive research, implementation, and report writing pertaining to diverse topics. Although additional research and coding components were included in each course, these projects represent the major works in the respective courses.
